abstract: Incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) is challenging to diagnose due to its lack of classic clinical features, yet it has a higher incidence of coronary artery lesions, making early detection crucial. Echocardiography plays a vital role in identifying these lesions, but differentiating incomplete KD from other febrile illnesses, such as COVID-19, is difficult. Algorithms capable of achieving expert-level performance are needed to aid diagnosis, particularly in the absence of pediatric cardiologists.
