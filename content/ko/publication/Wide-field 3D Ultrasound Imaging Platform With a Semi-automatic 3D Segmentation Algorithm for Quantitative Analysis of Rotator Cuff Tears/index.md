abstract: Rotator cuff tear (RCT) is a common injury that causes pain and disability in adults. The quantitative diagnosis of the RCT can be crucial in determining a treatment plan or monitoring treatment efficacy. Currently, only a few diagnosis tools, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging (US), are utilized for the diagnosis. Specifically, US exhibited comparable performance with MRI while offering a readily available diagnosis of RCTs at a lower cost. However, three-dimensional(3D) US and analysis of the regions are necessary to enable a better diagnosis of RCTs. Therefore, we developed a wide-field 3D US platform with a semi-automatic 3D image segmentation algorithm for 3D quantitative diagnosis of RCTs. The 3D US platform is built based on a conventional 2D US system and obtains 3D US images via linear scanning. With respect to 3D segmentation algorithm based on active contour model, frequency compounding and anisotropic diffusion methods were applied, and their effects on segmentation were discussed. The platform was used for clinical examination after evaluating the platform via the RCT-mimicking phantoms. As verified by the Dice coefficient(average DC- 0.663, volume DC- 0.723), which was approximately up to 50% higher than that obtained with conventional algorithms, the RCT regions segmented by the developed algorithm significantly matched the ground truth. The results indicated that the wide-field 3D US platform with the 3D segmentation algorithm can constitute a useful tool for improving the accuracy in the diagnosis of RCTs, and can eventually lead to better determination of treatment plans and surgical planning.
